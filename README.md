# Kamal Pandey — Portfolio

This project is a ReactJS conversion of the original static `porfolioJS` site.

It uses:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling and dev server
- React 18 functional components
- React Router for client-side routing
- The original CSS, slightly adjusted, for styling
- Public assets for images and logos

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Preview the production build:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Notes

- Navigation links in the header still scroll to the corresponding sections using hash links (e.g. `#projects`, `#about`).
- `handleIconClick` in the project sections now uses a React-friendly `onClick` handler which opens client websites in a new tab with `noopener,noreferrer` for security.
- The CSS is kept as a single file to preserve the original visual design. If you want stricter style scoping, you can progressively migrate these rules into CSS Modules or styled-components.
